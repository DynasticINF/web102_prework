## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenge 1: Parsing the JSON

Initially struggled with parsing the json for each game and placing the game data into elements on the page. But with hardwork and attentive problem solving skills, I was able to complete the task

Challenge 2: Creating the Description String

I was a bit confused on how to best incorporate template literals/the ternary operator into the description for the funds total, I was able to figure it out by breaking down the specified steps and utilizing documentation to better understand template literals and ternary operator
